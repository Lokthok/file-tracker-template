# Contributing

I'm learning and this project emerged from that journey. I welcome:

- **Bug reports** with clear reproduction steps
- **Feature ideas** with use case descriptions  
- **Code improvements** with explanations (help me learn!)
- **Documentation enhancements**

## Guidelines

**Be patient** – I'm 7 months into my software development training, but I'm committed to understanding every change and maintaining code quality.

**Open an issue first** for major changes so we can discuss before you invest time.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-idea`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test thoroughly** – run the script with different scenarios
5. **Commit with clear messages** (`git commit -m 'Add feature: description'`)
6. **Push to your fork** (`git push origin feature/your-idea`)
7. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - What you changed
   - Why you changed it
   - How to test it

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use clear variable names
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Keep functions focused and short

## Questions?

Open an issue with the `question` label – I'm happy to discuss!

## Thank You!

Every contribution helps me learn and makes this tool better for everyone. 🙏
